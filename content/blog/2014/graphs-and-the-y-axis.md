<p> For as long as I've been aware of this sort of thing, I've always been under the impression that it is wrong to create a graph where the y-axis doesn't start at zero. </p>

<p> And yet, here is a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/americans-opinions-on-spanking-vary-by-party-race-region-and-religion/">graph by Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight</a> that does exactly that: </p>

<img src="http://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/enten-datalab-spanking-1.png?w=610&amp;h=475">

<p> I remember being told in elementary school that doing this exaggerates the difference between values and should be avoided. </p>

<p> Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_draw_misleading_graphs#Incorrect_origin_of_the_Y-axis">seems to agree with me</a> but also notes that it's okay to not start at zero when zero is basically an impossible value to have on the graph. </p>

<p> Zero percent is pretty far from these values, but it's not an <i>impossible</i> value. </p>

<p> I suppose 50% can be defended as it's 1/2 of 100% and a nice breakpoint. And if the purpose of a graph is to visualize numbers and/or the change in numbers, this isn't a terrible graph. It accurately reflects the decline from 84% to 70% which is all you can ask of it. </p>

<p> Who knows, maybe I'm mis-remembering the rule. I certainly see enough graphs that don't start at zero that it's probably not as hard-and-fast rule as I recall it being. </p>
