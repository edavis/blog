Over the past few days I've been working on a repository of Emacs packages that can be installed via Homebrew. Now that it has a handful of useful packages available, it felt like a good time to officially introduce <a href="https://github.com/edavis/homebrew-emacs">homebrew-emacs</a> to the world.

It is a "<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.9">tap</a>" that, once installed, allows you to install <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> packages using the <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> package manager. The <a href="https://github.com/edavis/homebrew-emacs#readme">README</a> has installation and configuration instructions.

Package management is one of those things I really don't want to spend too much time thinking about. All of the existing Emacs package managers, I felt, required way too much configuration before they were usable. As I already use Homebrew for a bunch of other things, why not for Emacs packages, too?

My goal is to eventually have this tap blessed by the Homebrew maintainers as the official Emacs tap. Feedback and pull requests are welcome.
