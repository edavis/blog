I think that while most developers recognize that Wordpress isn't <i>terrible</i>, it's rarely the first choice for developers looking to build a personal programming blog.

So why did I choose Wordpress for my blog?

The answer in one word: laziness. Or, more accurately, lack of interest in <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx">yak shaving</a>.

I've dabbled with more blog publishing systems than I care to count. Like a lot of developers I was particularly interested in "static blogging" engines (e.g., Jekyll, Pelican, Octopress, etc.) that generate a directory of HTML from some sort of Markdown-esque inputs.

But without fail I would use these systems for a day or two and inevitably grow unhappy with them. For some, I grew unhappy with the look but didn't want to spend hours fiddling with CSS. For others, I never grew comfortable with how it wanted me to manage my blog posts. It felt like I was fighting against my blog rather than working with it.

I decided to give Wordpress a shot when it dawned on me that I've been spending months trying out every blog engine around rather than actually blogging. Wordpress has great themes, a large and active community, and plenty of extensions. But more importantly, I can actually focus on blogging rather than configuring blog engines.
