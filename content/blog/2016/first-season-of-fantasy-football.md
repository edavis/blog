I participated in my first ever fantasy football league this year. Overall, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I finished 4th out of 12 players, which is the highest a first-time player has finished in the decade or so history of the league. Unfortunately, it's just out of the money. But I can't wait play again this season. I'm even debating whether to start a league at work. Try my hand at being a commissioner.
