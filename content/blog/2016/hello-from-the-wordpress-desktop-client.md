So this is cool.

After Automattic released their new Wordpress.com platform,Â I stumbled upon the fact that they either were releasing a desktop client, too, or had always had a desktop client but I was hearing about it for the first time. Not sure which it was, to be honest.

I didn't do much with it at the time. Just filed it away in case I ever wanted to breathe some life into my long dormant blogs.

Then comes this morning where I've been working through a Wordpress template hierarchy issue for a couple of hours now. So I'm already in the Wordpress frame of mind. As I'm working through it, I realize the issue I'm working through would make for a pretty good blog post.

It clicks. Now is a perfect time to try out the Wordpress.com desktop client. So I download/install and I'm signed in all in a few minutes.

So far I'm digging it.

There's something about writing in a separate app that makes blogging feel more like email for me. When it comes to blogging in a web browser, it never feels natural to me. I don't know what it is. But when I'm writing an email to a co-worker, it just flows.

Alright, back to the template hierarchy issue. Hope to have a post up about it soon!
