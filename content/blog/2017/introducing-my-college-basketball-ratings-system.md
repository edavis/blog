With conference play starting up, I've finally put the finishing touches on my college basketball ratings system: <a href="http://ratings.ericdavis.io/">EJD CBB Ratings</a>. I wrote a bit about the technical details and how it came about <a href="http://wp.me/p8fHC0-x">here</a>.

Its goal is to predict the outcome of game featuring any two college basketball teams. It also serves as a way to teach myself more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_rating_system">sports ratings systems</a> in general and matrices/systems of equations in particular.
