I was feeling extra ambitious last night so I knocked out a bunch of things that have been on my todo list for awhile but never had gotten around to.

I went through my 1,200+ bookmarks that have accumulated over the years and purged just about every single one. I made a backup first, which helped me be aggressive. Down the road, should I need to dig one up, I'll be able to. Otherwise that file will sit quietly on Dropbox, out of sight and out of mind.

I found most of my bookmarks fell into one of two categories: a news article I saved to read later and resources I discover when I'm diving into a new project or learning about a new technology. Going forward, I'm going to start clearing out unread news articles after about a week. For technical resources, once I'm finished with a project I'm going to cull the bookmarks to the especially helpful ones and then toss them up to <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>.

After that, I went through my collection of domains and disabled auto-renew for the ones I'm not using anymore. Starting in February 2018, I'll be down to ericdavis.io, hnrss.org, and a domain/email package I set up for my parents. While the .io TLD is pricier than more common TLDs, I love that it has my full name in it. My goal is to eventually shift all my side projects into subdomains of ericdavis.io. I also <em>started</em> a new project. I created <a href="http://links.ericdavis.io/">links.ericdavis.io</a>, the future home of a linkblog I've had on my mind for awhile. I think linkblogs are an underutilized style of blogging, and I'm hoping I can breathe some life into the format. Stay tuned.

Finally, I took the posts from my two previous blogs and imported them into blog.ericdavis.io. The importer was a bit on the slow side (I have this blog hosted on wordpress.com), but overall they came in just fine. Also, I simplified the categories down to Technology and Sports.
