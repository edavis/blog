I was on this blog for the first time in months and realized a lot of what I wrote in the post before this and on the Projects page has changed!

The biggest change is that I'm not renewing the ericdavis.io domain and have scrapped plans of moving all my projects to subdomains underneath it.

Up until a few days ago, renewing ericdavis.io was still the plan but the Namecheap auto-renew failed (I hadn't realized that simply adding a new card wasn't enough. You have to enable auto-renew on the card, specifically.) Then I saw the ~$30 renewal amount and I just listened to my gut and decided that is a lot of cash for vanity. So it's in a grace period right now. I've moved what was "blog.ericdavis.io" to "ericdavislv.wordpress.com. I know there are deals for like $1/yr domains so I'll probably get one of those soon.

So the blog/links/rss subdomains are all gone now (links never took off and my RSS app had some fatal flaws). I also trashed spreadsheetbookie.wordpress.com (never wrote anything on it) and ejdbets.wordpress.com (a new blog with a bitcoin focus, but also never got off the ground). Rather than linger, I'm giving both a clean EOL. Kill your darlings and all that.

I'm less diligent than I was about keeping my bookmarks clean, but nowhere near as bad as before. I'm also using Chrome profiles more and more. Like I created a "Shopping" one for just Christmas shopping on Amazon this year. Feels nice to be able to boot into a fresh profile for projects like that.
