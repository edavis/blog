One thing I've always liked about the Git <a href="http://git-blame.blogspot.com/2015/07/git-25.html">release notes</a> is how new features are "learned" rather than "added." It's a small thing, but it makes it sound like Git is some intelligent agent that is slowly coming into its own rather than some tool created by humans. Your child "learns" the alphabet but you "add" fuel to your car.
