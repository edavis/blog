I'm <a href="http://recode.net/2015/07/28/windows-10-review-microsoft-takes-a-step-back-to-move-forward/">surprised</a> Windows 8 didn't make more headway. I knew a lot of people were unhappy with it — me included, I was completely clueless the few times I used it — but I always figured Microsoft would stick with it and people would eventually grow to like it. Guess not.
