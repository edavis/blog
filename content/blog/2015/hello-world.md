Hi, I'm Eric and this is my new blog.

I've tried — and failed — so many times at starting a blog it has become comical. I've tried nearly every flat-file blogging system out there. I've even taken stabs at writing my own. This isn't even the first <a href="https://ejd791.wordpress.com/2014/09/14/why-wordpress/">Wordpress blog</a> I've started. Each time I get all excited for a few days, then just slow down, then stop entirely. Of course, I'm not alone in this. How many blogs have you seen that go years between posts? I know I've seen a few.

This one may go the same path. Only time will tell.

Dave Winer says the defining aspect of a blog is the "<a href="http://scripting.com/2015/02/07/theUneditedVoiceOfAPerson.html">unedited voice of a person</a>." I really like that. I will try to stick to that as much as I can on this blog. I won't let perfect become the enemy of good. I have a habit of editing the hell out of whatever I write. The result is a few hundred words takes like two hours. That's too long. That's why I eventually stop. It takes too much time.

So I'm going to set a few guidelines for myself as I try to stick with this blog. Just type it out as I think of it. Don't edit it into the ground. Don't be afraid of short posts. Not everything has to be some opus. Try to write something every day. Try to get a streak going.
