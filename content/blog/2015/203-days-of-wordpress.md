I started building websites with WordPress back in January when I started my new job. Prior to that I worked almost exclusively with Django. I've been meaning to write about my experience making the change because it's not a common one. Most developers start with WordPress and eventually graduate to Django (and then write how much better Django is). Here are my impressions, in no particular order:
<ul>
	<li>Plain ole' WordPress is actually quite nice. In particular, I like how the default themes look 1000x better than anything I could put together.</li>
	<li>WordPress has built a great community built around it. I wish Django had something like <a href="http://make.wordpress.org">make.wordpress.org</a>.</li>
	<li>Django's documentation blows WordPress' documentation out of the water. Django treats documentation like a first-class citizen. WordPress' documentation often feels like an afterthought.</li>
	<li>There are maybe a couple dozen really top-notch WordPress plugins. I have no problem recommending or installing them myself. But beyond that, I'm not particularly impressed. I especially dislike the ones that clutter up your dashboard asking you to upgrade for premium features.</li>
	<li>It's really easy to write bad PHP code. Because PHP is not a tough language to pick up, a lot of code written by inexperienced developers is out there. In general, Python steers you in such a way that it's harder to write as bad of code.</li>
	<li>I love how widely used WordPress is. In general, when you encounter a problem it's not the first time and usually somebody has written up how to fix it.</li>
</ul>
Overall, I've grown to like WordPress. While there are parts I wish were a bit better, it's usually a joy to work with.
