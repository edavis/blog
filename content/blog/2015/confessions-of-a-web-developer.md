I do sometimes wonder whether my starting programming as a web
developer and not as <a
href="http://thad.frogley.info/archive/the_greatest_program.html">some
hardcore assembly hacker</a> will ultimately lower my ceiling on what
I can accomplish.

I've never really had to deal with memory management, hardware, or
stuff like that. I started by building super simple HTML pages,
learned some CSS, moved on to PHP before jumping ship to Python where
I've largely stayed. Of course I've dabbled with tons of languages in
between, but web and python programming is how I categorize what I do.

Would I be a better programmer if I had the battle scars of dealing
with low level stuff like memory and pointers? The canonical answer
here is "of course," but I have my doubts. For what I do and what I'm
interested in, I just don't always see the usefulness of that
low-level stuff. I'm building web pages, not web browsers.

The way I see it is programming is a tool to get stuff done. Decades
ago the tools were primitive. This imposed all kinds of constraints on
the human doing the programming. You had to manage memory yourself,
for example. But as the years progressed so did the tools. Now the
tools are advanced enough that we can offload that tedious stuff to
the computer and let the human focus on the bigger picture. Let's
celebrate that.
