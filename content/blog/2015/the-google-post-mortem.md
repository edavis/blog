I've been looking forward to reading this <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/08/02/google-plus-history/">post-mortem</a> ever since Google+ launched.

I remember jumping onto Google+ right after it launched and while the initial launch was exciting, it always just seemed obvious it would never catch on like Facebook.
